  - `Q10` – Our team has a clearly defined delivery cadence and meets planned outcomes.
  - `Q21` – Build, test, and deployment pipelines are fully automated.
- **Lead Time for Changes**
  - `Q3` – How long does it typically take from your first commit to production deployment?
  - `Q22` – Average time from code commit to deployment is typically less than one day.
- **Change Failure Rate**
  - `Q19` – The team has high confidence that released code meets reliability and performance expectations.
  - `Q20` – Defects found post-release are analysed and lead to preventative improvements.
  - `Q25` – Our build/test pipelines are stable and provide clear feedback when failures occur.
- **Time to Restore Service**
  - `Q23` – Automated rollback or recovery mechanisms are in place and tested.
  - `Q25` – Our build/test pipelines are stable and provide clear feedback when failures occur.
- **Reliability / Availability**
  - `Q19` – The team has high confidence that released code meets reliability and performance expectations.
  - `Q26` – Deployment and production telemetry are reviewed to guide improvements.

## BlueOptima Drivers
- **Commit Frequency**
  - `Q1` – On average, how often do you commit code to the main branch?
- **Pull Request Frequency**
  - `Q2` – How frequently do you open pull requests (PRs)?
- **Cycle Time**
  - `Q3` – How long does it typically take from your first commit to production deployment?
- **Intra-PR Activity**
  - `Q4` – How often do code reviews or PR discussions happen within your team?
  - `Q16` – All code changes go through peer review before merging.
- **Collaboration Time**
  - `Q5` – How much time per week is typically spent collaborating on code (e.g., pair programming, reviewing, co-debugging)?
- **Code Aberrancy / Quality Signals**
  - `Q6` – Does your team track any code-quality metrics (e.g., defects per PR, rework rate, code aberrancy)?
  - `Q17` – Automated unit and integration tests cover most critical paths.
  - `Q18` – Refactoring and technical-debt reduction are planned, recurring work items.

## SPACE Dimensions
- **Satisfaction & Well-being**
  - `Q31` – Overall, I'm satisfied with my day-to-day developer experience.
- **Performance**
  - `Q19` – The team has high confidence that released code meets reliability and performance expectations.
- **Activity**
  - `Q28` – I spend most of my time coding rather than on manual or repetitive tasks.
- **Communication & Collaboration**
  - `Q13` – Product, engineering, and design share a common understanding of priorities.
  - `Q12` – Dependencies across teams are proactively managed and rarely block progress.
- **Efficiency & Flow**
  - `Q27` – Development environments are consistent and easy to set up.
  - `Q30` – The tools and platforms we use help us move quickly without compromising quality.
